# Zachary Smart Portfolio #
# Description #
This weeks challenge I asked to Create a Portfolio to display my completed and ongoing work.

# Acceptance Criteria #

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
WHEN Portfolio is deployed at live URL
THEN Portfolio loads with no errors
WHEN i look at portfolio
THEN it ressembles the mock up provided in challenge instructions
